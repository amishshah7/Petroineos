-- instead of windows service, I would check possibility of hosting in cloud add trigger to that.
-- use TDD based approach
-- I have added projects as standard .net core so that it can either be used with .net framework or .net core
-- I didnt had time to add windows hosting project. will pass setting from app.config to extract service
-- need to careful of the memory and cpu consumption when running as a windows service
-- logging service is used as a project so that it can be easily integrated based on company wide logging approach. ie to console, file, sumo, sql etc.
-- I have tried to used dependency injection throughout so that take all its benefits
-- external dll classes/objects should be used only in its repository. 
-- run the inegration test to see the results exported to folder.
-- any 3rd party dll used to generate csv file should go through the company policies. 
-- yet to add windows service itself. will use this approach: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/windows-service
https://code-maze.com/aspnetcore-running-applications-as-windows-service/
-- there are todo comments in the .cs files
